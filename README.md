Me: SIMPIGIRWA Venant with 2101000084 as registration number I did all questions given. You may find them down there

Create a github account, create a repository, connect it with your workspace and do the questions below. By Friday, share with me the link to the repository.
Basic Java
1. Hello, Java!
   Write a Java program that prints "Hello, Java!" to the console.

2. Odd or Even?
   Create a Java program that takes an integer as input and determines whether it's odd or even. Print the result.

3. Factorial Calculator
   Implement a Java function to calculate the factorial of a given number. Test it with a few examples.

4. Palindrome Checker
   Write a Java program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. Ignore spaces and consider case sensitivity.

5. Fibonacci Sequence
   Create a Java function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. Print the sequence.

6. Sum of Digits
   Develop a Java program that calculates the sum of the digits in a given integer.

7. Reverse a String
   Write a Java function to reverse a given string. Test it with different input strings.

8. Prime Number Checker
   Implement a Java function to check whether a given number is prime or not. Print the result.

9. Array Manipulation
   Write a Java program that initializes an array, doubles each element, and then prints the modified array.

10. Simple Calculator
    Create a Java program that acts as a simple calculator. It should take two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input and display the result.

Basic OOP
1. Class and Object Basics:
   Define a class named `Car` with attributes such as `make`, `model`, and `year`. Create an object of this class and print its details.

2. Constructor Implementation:
   Add a constructor to the `Car` class from the previous question that initializes the attributes. Create another object using this constructor and print its details.

3. Encapsulation:
   Modify the `Car` class to encapsulate its attributes with private access modifiers. Implement getter and setter methods to access and modify these attributes.

4. Inheritance:
   Create a class `Sedan` that inherits from the `Car` class. Add an additional attribute specific to sedans. Instantiate an object of the `Sedan` class and print its details.

5. Polymorphism - Method Overriding:
   Override a method in the `Car` class, such as a method that prints the vehicle details. Demonstrate polymorphism by calling this method on both a `Car` and a `Sedan` object.

6. Interface Implementation:
   Define an interface named `Convertible` with a method `openRoof()`. Implement this interface in the `Sedan` class, and demonstrate the functionality.

7. Composition:
   Create a class `Engine` with attributes like `horsepower` and `fuelType`. Modify the `Car` class to include an instance of the `Engine` class. Print the details of the car's engine.

8. Abstract Class:
   Create an abstract class `Vehicle` with an abstract method. Implement this class in the `Car` class, and provide an implementation for the abstract method.

9. Static Members:
   Add a static variable to the `Car` class to keep track of the total number of cars created. Implement a static method to retrieve this count.

10. Exception Handling:
    Implement a method in the `Car` class that throws a custom exception when a certain condition is met, such as an invalid year. Handle this exception appropriately in your code.
